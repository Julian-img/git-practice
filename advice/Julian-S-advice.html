Well I’m here to tell you that you absolutely can! Believe in yourself, and continue your lessons, even when you feel discouraged. (Easier said than done, but as long as your doing then it doesn’t need to be said.)</span></h4>

As I continue to push I realize just how much I don’t know. Like there’s so many new things flying at you, all while you’re trying to memeorize what you just learned in a previous lesson, plus you have to remember to pay your phone bill, and get bananas from Trader Joe’s. Like this isn’t easy by a long shot, and I’m sure it’ll only become more challenging from here, but rather we know it or not, we are inching closer and closer to mastering this skill.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></h4>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2">When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s2"><b>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</b></span></h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</span></p>
